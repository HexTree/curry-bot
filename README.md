# CurryBot
Discord bot for the Azure Dreams community. CurryBot provides several useful command tools. It also has its own quirky personality; an obsession with Azure Dreams and Curry, and some weird love-hate relationship with Donforgo. 

Steps to get this up and running locally or on a cloud machine:

1) Clone git project

2) Copy the Bot token from Discordapp developers page, and paste it into a JSON file called "creds.json" in the discord_tools folder. Should look like:
{
  "token" : "..."
}

3) Download requirements in requirements.py (or use the sh script).
4) Run curry_bot.py
